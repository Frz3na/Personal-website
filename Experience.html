<h1> Academic Club: Under Faculty Banking which is called as Dbankers Club </h1>

<p>My position for this club is Exco Perhubungan, i remember back then the reason how i obtain this position is because i really love to talk and my style of talk just like "makcik membawang" üòÇ It is quite sad since during my semester 4, all students need to ODL Mode since PKP so i finished my diploma year at home not on the campus together with my friend. neverless, i enjoyed my first position as Exco Perhubungan and i have so much experience together with my diploma friend </p>

<h1> Academic Club: Under Faculty Finance which is called as Finceptive Club </h1>

<p>My position for this club is Exco Keusahawanan, the reason why i choose this position because i love money ü§£ Finceptive club really have a special place in my heart since i already treat all finceptive members as my family. I did learned a lot especially on how to handle event, searching supplier for our program, create poster & taking the picture during official event. I have a lot nickname at this club which is sometimes people called me Aliah, Zana, Bunga and gelabah since i tend to nervous and "gelabah" infront of people ·ïï( ·êï )·ïó </p>
